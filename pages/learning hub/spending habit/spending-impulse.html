    <h2 class="section-title">Impulse Buying</h2>

<h3 class="sub-title">How does impulse buying happen?</h3>
<p>
  Impulse buying happens when people make unplanned purchases because of sudden emotions rather than careful thought. Strong feelings, tempting offers, or pressure to act quickly can make it easy to confuse wants with needs. Emotional reactions like stress or the desire for instant happiness often override logical thinking, leading to purchases that may cause regret later.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-title">Psychology of Impulsive Buying</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Driven by emotions rather than rational planning</li>
  <li>Triggered by stress, boredom, or desire for instant gratification</li>
  <li>Often influenced by marketing pressure and urgency</li>
  <li>Can blur the line between wants and needs</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sub-title">Research Behind Impulsive Buying</h3>
<p>
  Studies show that the fast pace of online shopping encourages quick decisions. Research by Gottumukkala, Prasad, and Kumari (2023) highlights how emotions such as stress or boredom push people to buy things simply to feel better. Darrat, Darrat, and Amyx (2016) explain that anxiety and escapism also play a role, as shopping becomes a way to escape negative feelings. Combined with social media influence and constant exposure to promotions, these factors make impulsive buying more common today.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-title">What Triggers Impulse Buying</h3>
<p>
  Promotional stimuli like discounts, sales, and social media ratings strongly impact buying behavior. Emotional states, such as anxiety or excitement, reduce reflection and increase impulsivity. Sensory cues in physical stores — like music, layout, and atmosphere — stimulate the senses and encourage quick purchases.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Promotions and discounts create urgency</li>
  <li>Emotional states lower self-control</li>
  <li>Store atmosphere and product placement influence decisions</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sub-title">Why It Matters</h3>
<p>
  Understanding these triggers helps identify “buying traps” — situations where emotions, environment, or marketing pressures hijack decision-making. Recognizing that impulse buys often bypass rational evaluation encourages more mindful spending. By being aware of these influences, individuals can resist unnecessary purchases, improve budgeting, and build healthier financial habits.
